### Tyler Evers

- I'm a Software Engineer specializing in the .NET Stack while leveraging MS SQL Server for the data layer.
- More specifically I am currently focusing on building RESTful APIs along with various web scraping projects.
- Currently, I am working on expanding my knowledge in this tech stack (specifically with Blazor and Angular) alongside improving my knowledge and experience within Azure.

Outside of programming I enjoy hiking, watching football (Go Chiefs!), playing video games and spending time with my family and our dogs.
